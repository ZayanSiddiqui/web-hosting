                    <h3>Lion</h3>
                    <p>The lion is known as the "King of the Jungle." Lions are found mainly in Africa and are famous for their majestic manes. These animals live in groups called prides. They are predators and hunt large prey like zebras and buffaloes. Lions are social animals, and unlike most cats, they live together in family units. Lions can run at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour, but only for short distances. They communicate with roars that can be heard up to 5 miles away. Lions play an important role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. Male lions have impressive manes that protect their necks during fights. Unfortunately, they are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.</p>

                    <h3>Shark</h3>
                    <p>Sharks are one of the most powerful predators in the ocean. They have been around for more than 400 million years, even before dinosaurs. These creatures are highly skilled hunters and use their keen senses to track prey. Sharks are known for their sharp teeth and sleek bodies, which help them swim at great speeds. Most species of sharks are found in deep ocean waters, though some live in shallow coastal regions. Despite being feared, sharks are vital to the health of marine ecosystems. They help keep populations of other fish species in check. Sadly, sharks are threatened by overfishing and the loss of their natural habitat. Conservation efforts are essential to ensure their survival. There are more than 500 species of sharks, ranging from the tiny dwarf lantern shark to the enormous whale shark.</p>

                    <p>Butterflies are beautiful insects known for their colorful wings. They belong to the order Lepidoptera and are closely related to moths. Butterflies undergo a fascinating life cycle, starting as eggs, then larvae (caterpillars), and finally emerging as adults. The wings of butterflies are covered in tiny scales that reflect light, creating vibrant patterns. Butterflies play an important role in pollination, helping many plants reproduce. Their presence is often a sign of a healthy ecosystem. Some butterflies migrate over long distances, traveling thousands of miles to find food and suitable conditions. Unfortunately, many butterfly species are threatened by habitat destruction and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect their habitats and ensure their survival. Butterflies are also studied for their beauty and unique life cycle in biology.</p>
